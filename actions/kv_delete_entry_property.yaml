name: 'kv.delete_entry_property'
enabled: true
description: |
  Delete a property (if it exists) under a named entry (sub-object) of a
  serialized object in kv datastore. If the entry is empty after deleting
  the property, this deletes the entry as well.
  Fails if the key does not exist in the datastore.
  The kv object uses this structure: { entry: { property: value, ... }, entry: {}, ...}
  This action does not support encrypted datastore objects.
